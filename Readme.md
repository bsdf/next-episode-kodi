# script.service.next-episode

The addon for [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) mediacenter that uploads your video library data to
[next-episode.net](http://next-episode.net/) website.

## Installation

1. Download a .zip distribution from "Releases" tab of this repository.
2. In Kodi select **System** > **Add-ons** > **Install from zip file**.

**Warning!** The addon is still in beta version so bugs may be possible.

## Usage

After installation the addon will prompt you to enter your username/password for
[next-episode.net](http://next-episode.net/) and do a full video library update.

After a full update all your movies and episodes will be added to your next-episode.net inventory.
You can also initiate a full update from **next-episode.net** entry in **Programs** section
of Kodi Home menu or from the addon Settings.

The addon tracks your video library updates and uploads new movie and episode data to **next-episode.net**.
In addition to that, the addon monitors video playback and updates "watched" status for movies and episodes
to **next-episode.net**.

**Note!** The addon works only with Kodi video library data and *does not* work with videofiles that are not
added to the video library, for example videos from various video plugins.
